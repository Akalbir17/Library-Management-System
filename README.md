# Library-Management-System

## I have developed a library management system with the functions like insert, display, search and modify. There are two ways to develop a library management system depending on storing the data of the books: -
1.	Using Database Management System.
2.	Using File Handling.

But in this project, I have used database management mainly because of data security, ACID (Atomicity Consistency Isolation Durability), also the files remain in sync with the database and backups automatically include file binaries. So, these are the main reasons we have used database instead of file handling. We have also used GUI to make the library management system a bit more interactive
